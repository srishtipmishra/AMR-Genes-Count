Standard databases:
DB1: Fasta file with 4000 AMR genes <Name,Read>
DB2: SNP of these AMR genes

Collected databases:
DB3: Fastq files of sequence reads.
DB4: SAM created after alignment of the reads of fastq file

foreach alignment in SAM:
    rname = alignment.RNAME
    for gene,snp in DB2_SNP:
        if rname == gene:
            snpLocation = gene.getValue() %get location where this gene's polymorphism occurs
            qname = alignment.QNAME
            pos = alignment.POS
            length = alignment.length
            for reads in db3_fastq:
                if qname == reads.qname:
                    check CIGAR to make sure there's a match or mismatch or missing data
                    if match:
                        nucleotide = pos + location
                        verify this with AMR in FASTA file???
